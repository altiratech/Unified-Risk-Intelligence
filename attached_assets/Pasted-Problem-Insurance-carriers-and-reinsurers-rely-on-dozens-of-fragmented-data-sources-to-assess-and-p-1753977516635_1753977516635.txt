Problem

Insurance carriers and reinsurers rely on dozens of fragmented data sources to assess and price risk — from climate and catastrophe models to policy, claims, geospatial, and third-party data feeds. These sources often live in disconnected silos across legacy systems, spreadsheets, and vendor portals. This fragmentation leads to:
	•	Delayed or incomplete risk assessments
	•	Inconsistent underwriting decisions
	•	Redundant vendor spend
	•	Missed signals during catastrophes and renewals

Solution

We’re building a unified risk intelligence platform — a “single pane of glass” — that allows insurers to:
	•	Import data from any source via open APIs, CSVs, or internal systems
	•	Normalize and enrich the data with AI-assisted mapping and transformation
	•	Visualize risk across portfolios in geospatial, tabular, and temporal formats
	•	Run models on exposure, climate risk, cyber, or other emerging threats
	•	Export insights back into underwriting workflows or business intelligence tools

Think: Databricks + PowerBI + Plaid — purpose-built for risk professionals.

Why Now
	•	Climate risk, cyber, and CAT events are increasing in frequency and severity.
	•	Regulators and reinsurers demand better, explainable risk visibility.
	•	Insurers are actively modernizing data infrastructure but lack verticalized tools.
	•	Advances in LLMs and AI/ML make it easier to wrangle messy, semi-structured data at scale.

Differentiation

Unlike generic data platforms or niche risk tools, our platform is:
	•	Insurance-native — built with carriers and MGAs in mind
	•	API-first — plug in third-party sources like Demex, Zesty.ai, Tomorrow.io, CoreLogic, or internal systems
	•	AI-enhanced — use machine learning to uncover patterns, normalize entity data, and build risk scores
	•	Modular — export to Snowflake, Databricks, Excel, or integrate with policy admin tools

Go-to-Market
	•	Initial target: Mid-sized carriers, reinsurers, MGAs, and climate-focused risk consultants
	•	Pilot use cases: Property CAT aggregation, climate risk dashboards, cyber exposure mapping
	•	Revenue model: Tiered SaaS with usage-based pricing on data volume and API calls
