# Risk Intelligence Platform

## Overview

This is an insurance risk intelligence platform built as a full-stack web application that consolidates fragmented data sources into a unified dashboard. The application is designed for insurance carriers, reinsurers, MGAs, and risk consultants to assess, visualize, and manage risk exposure data across multiple channels.

## Recent Changes (August 1, 2025)

### Tomorrow.io Weather Layer Integration (Latest - August 1, 2025)
