## Authentication & Core Infrastructure ‚úÖ

### **TEST_JWT Authentication**
- ‚úÖ All protected endpoints accept Bearer token successfully
- ‚úÖ Environment variables loaded correctly with dotenv
- ‚úÖ Mock user context created for test scenarios
- ‚úÖ No breaking changes to production Replit OAuth

### **Database Integration**  
- ‚úÖ Test organization and user created successfully
- ‚úÖ PostgreSQL connection and schema operational
- ‚úÖ Raw CSV data stored in database (20 rows)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Risk exposure creation pending (requires mapping application)

### **API Architecture**
- ‚úÖ Health endpoint returns JSON (not HTML)
- ‚úÖ Express routing configured correctly
- ‚úÖ Protected endpoints properly secured
- ‚úÖ Public endpoints (weather, config) fully operational

## Core Functionality Results ‚úÖ

### **CSV Processing Pipeline**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "CSV uploaded and processed successfully",
  "processing": {
    "rowCount": 20,
    "fieldMappingSuggestions": 7,
    "autoApprovedMappings": 7,
    "warnings": []
  }
}
```
- ‚úÖ **Upload**: 20 rows processed from sample_exposures.csv
- ‚úÖ **Field Recognition**: 7 insurance fields auto-mapped with high confidence  
- ‚úÖ **Data Storage**: Raw data persisted in database
- ‚úÖ **Processing Speed**: 324ms for complete workflow

### **Weather Intelligence System**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "layerType": "temperature",
  "data": {
    "type": "FeatureCollection",
    "features": [6 geographic points with current conditions]
  }
}
```
- ‚úÖ **Real-time Data**: Tomorrow.io API integration functional
- ‚úÖ **Geographic Coverage**: 6 points across US with temperature data
- ‚úÖ **Data Format**: Proper GeoJSON with color coding

### **Configuration & Public APIs**
- ‚úÖ **Mapbox Integration**: Access token configured correctly
- ‚úÖ **Data Sources**: List endpoint returning uploaded CSV metadata
- ‚úÖ **Export Headers**: CSV export structure ready for data

## Performance Benchmarks

- **CSV Processing**: 324ms for 20 records (16ms/record)
- **Weather API**: 1.3s for temperature layer data
- **Database Queries**: <110ms average response time
- **Health Checks**: <5ms response time

## Current Workflow Status

### ‚úÖ **Completed Successfully**
1. **Authentication Patch**: JWT bypass working perfectly
2. **CSV Upload**: File processed and stored as raw data
3. **Field Mapping**: Auto-suggestions generated with high confidence
4. **Weather Intelligence**: Real-time data service operational
5. **Export Infrastructure**: Headers and structure ready

### üîÑ **Next Phase Required**
1. **Risk Exposure Creation**: Apply mappings to convert raw data to exposures
2. **Weather Data Linking**: Associate weather observations with exposures
3. **Complete Export**: Generate full CSV with all 20 risk exposure records

## Database State Verification

- **Organizations**: 1 test organization (`test-org`)
- **Users**: 1 test user (`test-runner`) 
- **Data Sources**: 1 completed CSV upload
- **Raw Data**: 20 rows successfully stored
- **Risk Exposures**: 0 (pending mapping application)

## Test Infrastructure Readiness

### ‚úÖ **Environment Configuration**
- TEST_JWT loaded and functional across all endpoints
- Database seeded with proper test data structure
- Sample CSV provides realistic insurance portfolio data
- All dependencies installed and operational

### ‚úÖ **API Testing Framework**
- Postman collection configured with Bearer authentication
- Jest test structure prepared with authentication constants
- Sample data covers 8 states and 6 peril types
- Value range from $580K to $3.2M provides realistic test scenarios
