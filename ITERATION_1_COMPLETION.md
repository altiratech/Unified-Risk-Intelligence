# Sprint 2 Iteration 1 - Alert System & Embed Auth Foundation - COMPLETED

## Iteration Summary
Successfully implemented the foundational alert system with threshold monitoring and embed authentication framework as planned for the first 40-hour iteration of Sprint 2.

## âœ… Completed Features

### 1. Alert System Backend Implementation

**Database Schema (PostgreSQL)**
- `alert_rules` table: Configurable threshold rules with JSON conditions
- `alert_instances` table: Triggered alert tracking with status management  
- `user_notification_preferences` table: User-specific notification settings

**Core Services**
- `AlertService`: Rule evaluation engine with condition processing
- `processAlerts` job: Background alert evaluation and notification delivery
- Notification support: Email (SMTP) and webhook delivery
- Threshold types: Sum, count, average, min, max aggregations

**API Endpoints**
- Complete CRUD operations for alert rules
- Alert instance management (acknowledge, resolve)
- Manual alert processing triggers
- Organization-scoped data access

### 2. Embed Authentication Foundation

**JWT-Based Security**
- Secure token generation with configurable expiration
- Origin validation with wildcard domain support
- Permission-based access control
- CORS configuration for cross-origin embedding

**API Implementation** 
- Token generation endpoint for admin users
- Authentication middleware for embed requests
- Test endpoints for validation
- Error handling with detailed messaging

### 3. Background Job System Enhancement

**Scheduled Processing**
- Alert evaluation: Every 2 minutes
- Raw data processing: Every 5 minutes  
- Manual job triggers via API

**Job Management**
- Status tracking and error logging
- Progress monitoring capabilities
- Cron-based scheduling in development

### 4. Comprehensive Testing

**Test Suites Created**
- `alert-system.test.js`: Complete alert workflow testing
- `embed-auth.test.js`: Authentication and security validation
- API endpoint coverage for all new features
- Error condition and edge case handling

## ðŸ“Š Technical Metrics

### Database Changes
- 3 new tables added (alert_rules, alert_instances, user_notification_preferences)
- Foreign key relationships established
- JSON column types for flexible configuration storage

### API Coverage
- 10+ new endpoints for alert management
- 2 embed authentication endpoints
- Enhanced job management with alert processing
- Proper error handling and validation

### Code Quality
- TypeScript throughout with Drizzle ORM type safety
- Zod schema validation for all inputs
- Comprehensive error handling
- LSP diagnostics clean (0 errors)

## ðŸ”§ Configuration Requirements

### Environment Variables Added
```env
# Alert System
SMTP_HOST=smtp.provider.com
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_USER=alerts@company.com
SMTP_PASS=secure_password
WEBHOOK_SECRET=random_32_char_string

# Embed Authentication
EMBED_JWT_SECRET=different_32_char_secret
CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://client1.com,https://client2.com
```

### Dependencies Added
- `nodemailer` and `@types/nodemailer` for email notifications
- `jsonwebtoken` for embed token generation
- Enhanced cron job scheduling

## ðŸŽ¯ Feature Demonstrations

### Alert System Example
```bash
# Create high-value threshold alert
curl -X POST /api/alert-rules \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer TOKEN" \
  -d '{
    "name": "High TIV Alert",
    "conditions": [{
      "field": "totalInsuredValue",
      "operator": "gt", 
      "value": 50000000,
      "aggregation": "sum"
    }],
    "notificationMethods": [{
      "type": "email",
      "config": {"recipients": ["risk@company.com"]}
    }]
  }'
```

### Embed Token Generation
```bash
# Generate widget embed token
curl -X POST /api/embed/generate-token \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer TOKEN" \
  -d '{
    "organizationId": "org-123",
    "allowedOrigins": ["*.replit.app"],
    "permissions": ["read"],
    "expiresInHours": 24
  }'
```
